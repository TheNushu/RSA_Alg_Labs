Week 1 report

* Hours spent: ~5-6 hours

* This week I was mainly concerned with reading the course instructions and choosing a good topic that is  complex enough, that it will challenge myself, be interesting and that is a suitable submission.
	* I have wanted to choose between an AI Chess player that always wins against a human and between a RSA encryption implementation. I have chosen the latter

* How has the project progressed:
	* I would say fairly well. Maybe I should've also started to code for it compared to just preparing and reading sources, but I am sure this will come useful along the way.

* What did you learn this week/today:
	* About unit testing:
		* I heard about unit testing before, but never implemented it in any of my projects. I am happy to learn such a powerful and useful approach.
	* Familiarised myself with the steps of RSA implementation and the different aspects and algorithms needed for key generation. I was impressed by the size of the prime numbers needed for this to be secured.
		* I also found out that before 2010s, key sizes of 1024 bits were considered secure for most attack types, but with the increase of computing power and hacker tactics (+ the relative cheapening of dollar/computing power).
			* Now key sizes of 2048 bits are recommended
	* AI Chess algorithms. I knew about alpha-beta-prunning algorithm for AI Chess with minimax before, but it was nice to refresh my memory about the topic.
		* Also an interesting problem that arose here is the fact that it is too computationally (basically takes too long in matters of time) to compute all possible moves.
			* An approach to solve this would be to predict what moves would provide best chances for a winning scenario by a combination of points.
				* (Ex, pieces in specific areas of the map would have more power=points and also specific pieces would have individual points.
					* the point system comes in handy to calculate ho each move would affect the scoring of both players.
* What has been unclear problematic:
	* I got a little confused on what the course wants to achieve from us/what are the course objectives exactly.
		* Reading the provided material and the recommended sources was really helpful.
		* Also the telegram channel where we can ask questions proved to be very useful for my concerns.
	* I don't think I've encountered any significant problems besides that since I have only explored areas and I didn't do anything practical as of yet.
	* I am a little intimidated by the task and not knowing how harsh/strict the requirements are, but I hope that it will be okay.
