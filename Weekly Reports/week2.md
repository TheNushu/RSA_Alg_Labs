* Used chat gpt 4 for examples of tkinter interfaces from which to learn, but it ended up beeing not useful and used examples from documentations
	* also sometimes for some bug fixing cases

* hours spent: 12

* This week I:
	* implmented the interface of the program with tkinter 
	* used an rsa python module to be able to work with the tkinter interface 
	* made the test files (without actual testing)
	* looked into coverage

* How did the project progress?
	* Not that well, I struggled with the implementation of the interface without spending that much time on implementing the encryption process.
		* used an encryption library to test if the interface works well with it
		* I think I finished the interface (has everything it needs to) so now I have time to work fully on the algorithm
		* tried to set up coverage, but still a work in progress

* What did you learn this week?
	* this week I learned about tkinter user interface
		* how to implement unittesting in a project (didn t implement it yet, so not that much)
		* delved deeper into coverage

* What has been problematic:
	* not sure if any deep problems. normal workflow i would say with the interface implementation
	* had some erros of while setting up coverage of "could not open file" and trying to look into that

* What's next:
	* implementing rsa fully on my own (and library help where needed)
	* unittesting
	* coverage setting up
	* pylint setting up
