Hello there!

The code has some bugs at the moment, so please bear with me for it. It is somewhat functional.

Libraries needed:
* tkinter
* random

How to use:

* run app.py to see the interface
* press "Generate keys"
* copy each key and paste it into their required fields
* write a text you want to encrypt in the first field
* click "encrypt button"
	* after encrypting, the encrypted text is automatically copied to your clipboard
* paste the encrypted text in the "text to be decrypted field"
* press decrypt
* you should have now your original text in the output field

WARNING:

* there is a bug currently, which makes the app able to encrypt a text only once per session
* if you wish to encrypt multiple words, you'll need to restart the app before each decryption
* I am sorry for this, I am looking to fix the issue

* Update: bug fixed; make sure to clear that the fields of keys and encrypted text are free before pasting
	This ensures that you use the correct values and you do not get confused by the weird UI where you
	cannot see the whole text

Other problems:

* code might not be fully suitable with good python practice because I had problems setting up pylint
	*also problems with coverage
* some comments might not be clear enough
* probably some other bugs lie around since unitests don't get approved 
* I will need to switch the "random" library with "secrets", such that it can be cryptographically secured (random numbers from random library can be predicted)

Please excuse my low skill and I hope that you can enjoy this!
