## Installation

Clone the repository on your machine in a folder that you desire to run it
```
git clone git@github.com:TheNushu/RSA_Alg_Labs.git
```
To start the app, you will need to run the file app.py. This can be achieved either through the command line, with the following commands once you are located in the root directory:

```
cd RSA_app
```
```
python3 app.py
```
This can be achieved also by opening the directory with an IDE and running the app.py file
